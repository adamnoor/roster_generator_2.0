# roster_generator_2.0

Roster Generator is a program that allows users to select players they think will perform well in Draft Kings and create all of the valid permutations that include those players.  Once all of the permutations are generated, the user is walked through a process of restricting the list of rosters by either including or excluding plyaers until the list managable giving the user a good number of options to chosse from.  The script also allows the user to add projection data from Fantasy Focus to help aid in that decidion.

To run the script, run the main.py file.  The input_files folder must contain a file called players.csv and a file called projections.cvs.  Provided in the input_files folder are three sample files that can be used to populate the players.csv file, a players.csv file that is populated with the small data set out of the box and a projection.csv file that is aligned to match the data set with some missing to show how the program functions when players cannot be found.
